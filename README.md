# SCARA Robot Arm Simulation

This project simulates the movement of a SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) robot arm using inverse kinematics. It includes functionalities to generate videos for various shapes such as rectangles, triangles, circles, squares, pentagons, and cubes.

## Features

- Simulation of SCARA robot arm movement using inverse kinematics
- Generation of video animations for different shapes:
  - Rectangles
  - Triangles
  - Circles
  - Squares
  - Pentagons
  - Cubes

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Imageio

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
